Matlab implementation of Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) algorithm for corner detection.

BRISK, FREAK, SURF, Block methods are supported.

Three test functions are included:
- tester: find common corners between two images;
- tester2: find corners of a single image and compare it with detectFASTFeatures Matlab function;
- tester3: stitch together multiple sequential images into a single one.
